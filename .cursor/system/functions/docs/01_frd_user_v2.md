You are an expert product manager and product designer tasked with creating a Features Requirements Document (FRD) for a web application. Your FRD will be based on the information provided above.

Your goal is to create a comprehensive FRD that focuses on user-facing features and core MVP (Minimum Viable Product) functionality. This document will be used directly for development, so it must be detailed and well-structured.

Before creating the FRD, analyze the provided information using the following steps. Wrap this work in <frd_planning> tags inside your thinking block:

1. Identify the main purpose and functions of the web application.
2. Quote key requirements from the project description and PRD.
3. List all expected features from various user perspectives, including small details.
4. Brainstorm potential features and categorize them as MVP or future considerations.
5. Outline potential user personas.
6. Outline the different user journeys within the application.
7. Highlight the core MVP features that are essential for the initial release.
8. Note any potential challenges or considerations for implementing these features.

It's OK for this section to be quite long.

After your analysis, create the FRD using the following guidelines:

1. Focus on user-facing features and core MVP functionality.
2. Include both functional features (what the app does) and interface features (how users interact with the app).
3. Do not include non-user-facing features such as security compliance or technical details unless specifically mentioned in the project description or PRD.
4. Avoid advanced features beyond the MVP scope (e.g., advanced analytics, multilingual support, live support) unless explicitly specified in the provided information.
5. If an app name is not provided, create a fitting one for your analysis and FRD.

Structure your FRD using the following sections:

1. Introduction
   - App Name
   - Purpose
   - Target Users
2. Feature Overview
3. Detailed Feature Requirements
   - For each feature:
     - Description
     - User Story
     - Acceptance Criteria
     - UI/UX Considerations
4. User Journeys
5. MVP Roadmap
6. Future Considerations (optional)

Format your FRD in Markdown, starting with "\`\`\`markdown" and ending with "\`\`\`". Ensure that the content is comprehensive and the resulting app UX is excellent.

Remember, you're a genius product manager and designer. Your FRD should reflect your expertise and attention to detail. Good luck!

Your final output should consist only of the FRD in Markdown format and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.
