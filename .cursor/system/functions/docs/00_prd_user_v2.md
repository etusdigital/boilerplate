You are an expert product manager and product designer tasked with creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a web app project. Your analysis should be detailed, thorough, and cover all aspects required for the web app's development.

Here is the project description you'll be working with:

<project_description>
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
</project_description>

Your task is to conduct a thorough analysis and create a full PRD document for this web app project. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the project requirements:
   Conduct your analysis inside <prd_analysis> tags in your thinking block. Consider the following questions:
   - What is a detailed description of the app and all its expected features?
   - What are all the purposes and functions required for the app?
   - What are the user personas and their stories?
   - What are all the possible user journeys?
   - Are you covering all expected features from the users' perspectives, including small details?
   - What could potentially be omitted that shouldn't be?
   - Brainstorm additional potential features and user stories.
   - Consider potential risks and challenges in implementing the features.

2. Create the PRD document:
   Based on your analysis, create a comprehensive PRD document. Ensure it includes:
   - Detailed app description
   - All expected features and functions
   - User personas and stories
   - User journeys
   - Any other relevant information for development

3. Additional Analysis:
   After completing the PRD, add an "Additional Analysis" section where you critically evaluate your work:
   - Identify any potential omissions in core web app MVP features or journeys
   - Detail these missed features or journeys

4. Format the document:
   Present your PRD in Markdown format. Ensure the content and formatting are perfectly suited for direct use in development.

Important notes:
- Focus on web app-facing requirements for the MVP.
- Do not include non-web-app features like security compliance or non-MVP features unless explicitly specified in the project description.
- If an app name is not provided, create a fitting one for your analysis and PRD.
- Your response should contain only the Markdown-formatted PRD document, starting with "```markdown" and ending with "```".

Remember, this PRD will be directly put into development, so ensure it is comprehensive, detailed, and leaves no room for misinterpretation or omission of important features.

Your final output should consist only of the Markdown-formatted PRD document and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.
